  - **Set up remote repo**

- When you clone your fork, it will automatically set your fork as the "origin" remote. Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your fork (which you copied in step 3) next to the word "origin". 
If you don't see the "origin" remote, you can add it using the git command below.

        > git remote add origin <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>

- Now you have to set up the upstream. write the following Git command to set up the upstream.
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/Live-Code-Editor.git
 
- Now pull the latest changes from original repo to your local changes by firing the below command
        > git pull upstream master
  
- **It's Code Time now**
  
After getting the project in code editor, make necessary changes keeping the features in mind available in readme.

   - **Now it's time to save the work**

      - Make a branch for the feature you have worked on
        > git checkout -b feature_branch_name
      - Stage the changes you have made by firing the below command
        > git add .
      - Commit the changes 
        > git commit -m "Description of changes in your work"
      - Push the changes to your forked repo in that specific feature branch
        >  git push origin feature_branch_name
        
     Note: Create a branch for that feature and push there. No direct push to master.
